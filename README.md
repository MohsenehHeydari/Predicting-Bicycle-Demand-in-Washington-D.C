# Predicting-Bicycle-Demand-in-Washington-D.C
This project mainly investigates the performance of supervised machine learning to predict bicycle demands for Washington D.C out of the data measurement from the Capital Bikeshare system. The dataset included different factor such as weather, snow, wind, hour of days, seasons and etc. All these factors were analyzed to get a better performance.
The dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and reducing dimensionality through correlation analysis. The project aimed to implement
different model of machine learning such as logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, Linear Discriminant analysis and classification tree. In case to compare which model performs best, classification report was applied and it evaluated metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision and recall.
